# Welcome to the py-portfolio-index Contributing Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/greenmtnboy/py-portfolio-index/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 


## Setting Up Your Environment

Recommend that you work in a virtual environment with requirements from both requirements.txt and requirements-test.txt installed. The latter is necessary to run
tests (surprise). 

## Running Tests

The tests are implemented primarily in pytest.
